### [Introduction to APIs](01_introduction.md)

API stands for Application Programming Interface. An API allows for different software systems to effectively communicate with one another. They act as middlemen, allowing for applications to send and receive data.

Some Examples of API:
-**Twitter/X API:** Allows for developers automatically using a program.
-**Google Maps API:** Allows for applications to embed directions and maps directly.

### [API Requests and Responses](02_request_response)
 APIs use the HTTP protocol to handle requests and responses.  
- **HTTP Methods:**  
  - `GET`: Retrieves data.  
  - `POST`: Sends data.  
  - `PUT`: Updates data.  
  - `DELETE`: Removes data.
