### [Introduction to APIs](01_introduction.md)

API stands for Application Programming Interface. An API allows for different software systems to effectively communicate with one another. They act as middlemen, allowing for applications to send and receive data.

Some Examples of API:
-**Twitter/X API:** Allows for developers automatically using a program.
-**Google Maps API:** Allows for applications to embed directions and maps directly.
